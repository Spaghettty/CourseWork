Hey dude, some stuff you may want to talk about.

#Seperation of Concerns
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns

GUI - Angular/HTML/CSS
 | |
REST API - Java
 | |
Database - MySQL

A user has no details for the database and therefore cannot access it without going through the API; this principle is used in industry as a Java application is vulnerable to security exploits.

# Limitations
* Despite being a REST API it only supports one user at a time
* No score tracking
* Testing is limited
